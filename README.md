kana-app
========

Kanapp is an application which allows you to learn Kana ( Japanese language ) 

You can play with a quizz or browse the Kana list.

This is a C++ project, it uses Qt library for the GUI.

I wanted to learn C++ language and I wrote this application during the summer holidays!


##Todo
Move files into folders to improve the structure of the application

##Notes
Don't forget to talk about the author if you want to use my works!
